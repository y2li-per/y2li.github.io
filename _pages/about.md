I'm currently an associate professor in [School of Communication Engineering](https://comm.hdu.edu.cn/main.htm), [Hangzhou Dianzi University](https://www.hdu.edu.cn/main.htm). My research interests includes trust-worthy AI, machine unlearning, unlearnable examples. I earned my PhD from Zhejiang University in 2023. I am also interested in Tennis (USTA 3.5+).
